          BNB Hyper Rise is an innovative elastic token that has a manual rebase
          function & rewards in BNB. Hyper Rise is developing an idle game
          called Hyper Rocket, which allows users to earn BNB by playing, while
          also building up a buy back wallet for BNB Hyper Rise.

              You receive Hyper Fuel by collecting rockets. Upgrading them
              increases the rate of fuel generation, this Hyper Fuel can be
              exchanged for BNB. <br />
              <br />
              Different tiers of rockets generate Hyper Fuel at different rates.
              <br />
              <br />A portion of the BNB from Hyper Rocket will go to a BNB
              Hyper Rise buyback wallet, allowing the chart behavior to be even
              more bullish.

            <h2>What is a Rebase token?</h2>
            <p>
              A rebase (or elastic) token is designed in a way that the
              circulating supply adjusts automatically according to price
              fluctuations, supply, and demand, without changing the overall
              value of the usersâ€™ holdings.
